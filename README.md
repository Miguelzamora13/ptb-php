# 🌟 Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

This library utilizes the latest features of **PHP 8** and aims to excel in terms of **speed**, **scalability**, and **usability**. It enables you to swiftly create basic bots while also offering advanced capabilities to handle even the most intricate workflows. Some fundamental principles underlying **PTB-PHP** draw inspiration from another open-source project called [Nutgram](https://github.com/nutgram/nutgram)! Be sure to check it out as well!

# 💡 Basic Example <a name="basic-example"></a>

```php
<?php

use function DevDasher\PTB\configurePTB;
use function DevDasher\PTB\middleware;
use function DevDasher\PTB\onMessage;
use function DevDasher\PTB\onMessageText;
use function DevDasher\PTB\run;
use function DevDasher\PTB\sendMessage;

// require(__DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php'); // You can use Composer's autolaoder
require(__DIR__.'/path/to/PTB.php'); // Or require the PTB.php file directly

/*
    This function is for setting the initial settings of the library
    It should be defined and called at the top of the code and before the handlers
*/
configurePTB(
    token: 'TOKEN', // Your bot token
    username: 'USERNAME', // Your bot username
    is_webhook: false, # Webhook OR LongPolling?
    // ...
);


# A middleware before handlers
middleware(callable: function() {
    sendMessage('Global Middleware');

    // This will execute automatically before the main handlers
});



# This handler is used to check text inputs on the 'message' update type
onMessageText(
    # Enter your text pattern here
    pattern: '/start|/begin', // Here, we specified two commands

    # The function that is executed after checking the pattern on response to the user
    callable: function() { 
        sendMessage(text: 'Hello World'); // A function to send a message to the user

        /*
            In short, if the user sends the /start OR /begin commands to the bot,
            the response "Hello World" will be sent to the user
        */
    },
);


# Here we examine another example together
onMessageText(
    # Text pattern with a placeholder
    pattern: 'My name is {name}', 
    
    # The function that is executed after checking the pattern on response to the user
    callable: function($name) { // Note that you receive the corresponding placeholder as a parameter on the function
        sendMessage(text: "Hello $name");

        /*
            In short, if the user sends the following text:
            "My name is Pooria"
            The bot will also send the reply "Hello Pooria" to the user
        */
    },
);


# A handler for 'message' update type
onMessage(callable: function() {
    sendMessage('onMessage');

    /*
        In short, any type of message that the user sends directly to the bot,
            this handler is called and a message with the value "onMessage" is sent to the user.

        Of course, this happens if the updates sent do not match the previous handlers
    */
});


# Other handlers goes here.


/*
    This function should always be at the end of the code (after the handlers).
    After this function is called, the library checks the available handlers
    and executes the relevant codes accordingly and sends the appropriate response to the user
    The response you specified on an anonymous function on previous handlers
*/
run();


```

These features provide a comprehensive toolkit for building powerful and flexible Telegram bots.

# ❓ Why Procedural and NOT OOP? <a name="why-procedural"></a>

Procedural programming is often considered faster than Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) due to its lower overhead and the smaller number of operations required for execution. In procedural programming, the focus is on writing sequential instructions on a step-by-step manner to accomplish a task. This approach allows for efficient execution as the program directly operates on data using straightforward instructions.

One key factor that contributes to the perceived speed advantage of procedural programming is the reduced number of OPcodes (operation codes) involved. OPcodes are fundamental instructions understood by the computer's hardware and define specific operations like arithmetic calculations or memory access. Since procedural programs typically involve fewer layers of abstraction and direct manipulation of data, they tend to require fewer OPcodes to achieve a given functionality.

In contrast, OOP introduces additional layers of complexity through concepts such as classes, objects, and inheritance. While these features provide benefits like code reusability, modularity, and maintainability, they also introduce some performance overhead. OOP programs often involve more intricate interactions between objects, which may require additional processing steps and indirections. These factors can lead to a slightly slower execution compared to procedural programs, especially on scenarios where performance is critical and the additional features of OOP are not heavily utilized.

It is important to note that the performance difference between procedural and OOP approaches is contextual and may vary based on several factors, such as the specific programming language used, the efficiency of the compiler or interpreter, the design choices made, and the nature of the problem being solved. Therefore, while procedural programming can be perceived as faster due to its streamlined execution model and reduced OPcode usage, it is not a definitive rule, and OOP can provide significant advantages on terms of code organization, maintainability, and extensibility.


# 📚 Documentation <a name="documentation"></a>

This library is continuously updated and offers a wide range of features.

The following list represents just a fraction of the library's capabilities, and we are actively working expand this documentation. Here are some of the key highlights:


## ⚙️ Configuration <a name="configuration"></a>

To use the library, you must configure it by setting at least two mandatory parameters. Here's an example:

```php
use function DevDasher\PTB\configurePTB;

configurePTB(
    token: 'TOKEN',
    username: 'USERNAME',
    // ...
);
```

### Available Configuration Parameters <a name="available-configuration-parameters"></a>

| Parameter                                 | Required | Description                                                        
|-------------------------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------
| `string $username`                        | ✅       | The bot username used for identification.                          
| `string $token`                           | ✅       | The bot token required to authenticate and access the Telegram API. 
| `string $api_base_url = API_BASE_URL`     | ❌       | The base URL for the Telegram API. Default is 'https://api.telegram.org', but you can provide your own custom base URL.
| `array $curl_options = []`                | ❌       | Additional cURL options for sending requests to the Telegram API. Some options are already set by default, but you can add or overwrite them using this parameter.
| `bool $is_webhook = false`                | ❌       | Set this to `true` if you want to use Webhook to receive updates from Telegram. This is suitable for production environments. By default, Long Polling is used (`false`).
| `?CacheInterface $cache = null`           | ❌       | A cache adapter implementation that will be used for caching purposes. You can pass a cache adapter object that implements the `Psr\SimpleCache\CacheInterface`.
| `array $update = []`                      | ❌       | Allows you to set the input update sent from Telegram servers manually, or add a fake update for testing purposes.
| `array $global_data = []`                 | ❌       | An optional array of key-value pairs that allows you to store global data (e.g., configuration values) accessible to all middlewares and handlers in the library using `_getGlobalData(...)` helper. The `_setGLobalData(...)` does the same thing.
| `?array $allowed_updates = null`          | ❌       | Defines the allowed types of updates that the library should handle. You can effectively determine allowed updates through the `setWebhook` method. Updates that are not allowed will be automatically rejected by the library. This provides an additional layer of validation for incoming updates.

## 📤 Uploading Files <a name="uploading-files"></a>

Here is some examples of how you can send files to the user in different ways:

```php
use function DevDasher\PTB\onMessageText;
use function DevDasher\PTB\sendPhoto;
use function DevDasher\PTB\sendVideo;
use function DevDasher\PTB\InputFile;

onMessageText(pattern: '/photo', callable: function() {
    $response = sendPhoto(
        # Pass your photo path:
        photo: 'path/to/photo.jpg',

        # Or you can use the InputFile function like this:
        // photo: InputFile(file_path: 'path/to/photo.jpg'), 

        # Or pass the file_id like this:
        // photo: 'FILE_ID',

        # Or pass a URL:
        // photo: 'https://example.com/path/to/photo.jpg',

        caption: 'This is your photo caption!',

        //...
    );
    //...
});

onMessageText(pattern: '/video', callable: function() {
    $response = sendVideo(
        # Pass your video path:
        video: 'path/to/video.mp4',

        # Or you can use the InputFile function like this:
       // video: InputFile(file_path: 'path/to/video.mp4'), 

        # Or pass the file_id like this:
        // video: 'FILE_ID',

        # Or pass a URL:
        // video: 'https://example.com/path/to/video.mp4',

        caption: 'This is your video caption!',

        //...
    );
    //...
});

//...
```

## 📥 Downloading Files <a name="downloading-files"></a>

And here is an example of how you can download files sent to the bot:

```php
use function DevDasher\PTB\_download;
use function DevDasher\PTB\_downloadBotFile;
use function DevDasher\PTB\_messageId;
use function DevDasher\PTB\_photo;
use function DevDasher\PTB\getFile;
use function DevDasher\PTB\onMessagePhoto;
use function DevDasher\PTB\sendMessage;

onMessagePhoto(callable: function() {
    $photo = _photo(); // A Helper, to get the photo details sent to the bot
    $response = sendMessage(
        text: 'Downloading...',
        reply_to_message_id: _messageId(),
    );
    $file = getFile(file_id: $photo['file_id']); // Get details about the photo (photo path on Telegram servers...) 
    if (!$file['ok']) {
        return sendMessage(text: 'Something went wrong!');
    }
    $result = _downloadBotFile(
        # Pass the $file array here:
        file: $file,

        # Or you can pass the $photo['file_id'] here directly:
        // file: $photo['file_id'],

        # Specify the destination and the file name:
        save_path: 'where/to/save/this/file.jpg',
    );
    if (!$result) {
        return editMessageText(
            text: 'An error occurred!',
            message_id: $response['result']['message_id'],
        );
    }
    return editMessageText(
        text: 'Photo downloaded.',
        message_id: $response['result']['message_id'],
    );
});

// For the rest (video, sticker, etc), it is almost the same
```

Alternatively, you can use the `_download(...)` function to download files, but you need to pass the url to it:

```php
use function DevDasher\PTB\_download;

//...
    $url = 'https://api.telegram.org/file/botTOKEN/FILE_NAME.jpg';
    $result = _download(
        url: $url,
        save_path: 'where/to/save/this/file.jpg',
    );
//...
```

It's better to use the `_downloadBotFile(...)` function.


## 🤖 Multiple Bot Management <a name="multiple-bot-management"></a>

You can manage your bots easily. see this example:

```php
use function DevDasher\PTB\_registerNewBot;
use function DevDasher\PTB\configurePTB;
use function DevDasher\PTB\onMessage;
use function DevDasher\PTB\sendMessage;

# You set the first and default bot details here:
configurePTB(
    token: 'TOKEN',
    username: 'USERNAME',
    //...
);

onMessage(callable: function() {
    # A helper function to add a new bot, do this anywhere you want:
    _registerNewBot(
        token: 'SECOND_BOT_TOKEN',
        username: 'SECOND_BOT_USERNAME',
        //...
    );

    # By default, all requests will be sent to the main (default) bot:
    $response = sendMessage(text: 'Hey there!');

    # Now, we send a message to the second bot like this:
    $response = sendMessage(
        text: "What's up bro?",

        # This parameter is present in all functions (related to sending requests)
        _options: [
            # Here, you can specify the second bot username:
            'bot_username' => 'SECOND_BOT_USERNAME',

            # Or you can pass the second bot's token directly:
            'bot_token' => 'SECOND_BOT_TOKEN',

            //...
        ],

        //...
    );

    //...
});

//...
```

## 🤝 Middlewares <a name="middlewares"></a>

Middleware is a layer of code that intercepts and processes requests and responses in web applications. It provides a modular and reusable way to handle common tasks such as authentication, logging, error handling, and data validation. Each middleware component inspects and modifies the request and response objects and can either terminate the cycle or pass control to the next middleware. By promoting separation of concerns and modularity, middleware allows for easy customization and maintenance of web applications. It is widely used enhance functionality, security, and maintainability.

In PTB-PHP there are two types of middlewares:

- Global Middlewares
- Local Middlewares

### Global Middlewares <a name="global-middlewares"></a>

These middlewares always executes before handlers automatically

If you remember, we have already seen a simple example of it above.

```php
use function DevDasher\PTB\middleware;
use function DevDasher\PTB\onMessageText;
use function DevDasher\PTB\sendMessage;

# Defining a middleware:
middleware(
    callable: function() {
        //...
        //...
        sendMessage(text: 'Global middleware 1');
        //...
        //...
    },
    name: 'GLOBAL_MIDDLEWARE_1', // Optional. The name of this middleware.
);
# You can define another middleware like above here.

onMessageText(pattern: '/start', callable: function() {
    sendMessage(text: 'START');
});
```

#### Defining Multiple Middlewares <a name="defining-multiple-middlewares"></a>

```php
use function DevDasher\PTB\middlewares;
use function DevDasher\PTB\onMessageText;
use function DevDasher\PTB\sendMessage;

middlewares(callables: [
    'GLOBAL_MIDDLEWARE_1' => function() { // 1
        //...
        //...
        sendMessage(text: 'Global middleware 1');
        //...
        //...
    },

    'GLOBAL_MIDDLEWARE_2' => function() { // 2
        //...
        //...
        sendMessage(text: 'Global middleware 2');
        //...
        //...
    },
]);

// The previous two middlewares will always run before these handlers:

onMessageText(pattern: '/start', callable: function() {
    sendMessage(text: 'START');
});

onMessageText(pattern: '/help', callable: function() {
    sendMessage(text: 'HELP');
});
```

#### Skipping Global Middlewares <a name="skipping-multiple-middlewares"></a>

You can skip one or more global middlewares from being running for special handlers:

```php
use function DevDasher\PTB\middlewares;
use function DevDasher\PTB\onMessageText;
use function DevDasher\PTB\sendMessage;

middlewares(callables: [
    'GLOBAL_MIDDLEWARE_1' => function() { // 1
        sendMessage(text: 'Global middleware 1');
    },

    'GLOBAL_MIDDLEWARE_2' => function() { // 2
        sendMessage(text: 'Global middleware 2');
    },
]);


onMessageText( // The previous two middlewares will always run before this handler.
    pattern: '/start',
    callable: function() {
        sendMessage(text: 'START');
    },
);

onMessageText(
    pattern: '/help',
    callable: function() {
        sendMessage(text: 'HELP');
    },

    # Here, pass the names of global middlewares in array like this:
    skip_middlewares: ['GLOBAL_MIDDLEWARE_2'], 
    # The global middleware with the name 'GLOBAL_MIDDLEWARE_2' will NOT execute before this handler
);
```

### Local Middlewares <a name="local-middlewares"></a>

It is possible to define a separate middleware for each handler:

```php
use function DevDasher\PTB\middleware;
use function DevDasher\PTB\onMessageText;
use function DevDasher\PTB\sendMessage;

middleware(callable: function() { // 1
    sendMessage(text: 'Global middleware 1');
});

onMessageText(
    pattern: '/start',
    callable: function() {
        sendMessage(text: 'START');
    },

    # Defining local middleware for this handler:
    middlewares: [
        function() { // This local middleware will execute only before this handler.
            sendMessage(text: 'Local middleware 1');
        },
    ],
);

onMessageText(
    pattern: '/help',
    callable: function() {
        sendMessage(text: 'HELP');
    },
);
```

### Real World Example <a name="middlewares-real-world-example"></a>

```php
use Symfony\Component\Cache\Adapter\FilesystemAdapter;
use Symfony\Component\Cache\Psr16Cache;

use function DevDasher\PTB\_getGlobalData;

configurePTB(
    token: 'TOKEN',
    username: 'USERNAME',

    cache: new Psr16Cache(new FilesystemAdapter()),
    //...
);

middlewares([
    'CollectUserMiddleware' => function() {
        # Some code here to save user info in the database
        // $user = save_user_info_in_database(/*...*/);
        //...
        //...
        //...

        # Here we assume that we have saved the user information in the previous codes
        #   and here we define only an array of it:
        $user = [
            'id' => 1, // ID in the database
            'user_id' => _user('id'),
            'first_name' => _user('first_name'),
            'username' => _user('username'),
            'is_banned' => false,
            'is_admin' => true,
            //...
        ];
        _setGlobalData('user', $user); // A helper, to save some data in global state
        // Means that we can access to this user info with the _getGlobalData(...) in all handlers
    },

    'CheckUserStatusMiddleware' => function() {
        $user = _getGlobalData('user'); # Get user data from global state
        if (isset($user['is_banned']) && $user['is_banned']) {
            throw new Exception('You are banned from bot!');
        }
    },

    //...
]);

onMessageText(pattern: '/start', callable: function() {
    $user = _getGlobalData('user'); 
    sendMessage(text: "Welcome {$user['first_name']}");
});

onMessageText(
    pattern: '/admin',
    callable: function() {
        sendMessage(
            text: "Welcome to the admins panel:",
            reply_markup: InlineKeyboardMarkup(inline_keyboard: [
                _row(InlineKeyboardButton(text: 'Users', callback_data: 'panel/users')),
                _row(InlineKeyboardButton(text: 'Stats', callback_data: 'panel/stats')),
            ]),
        );
    },
    middlewares: [
        function() { // Check if user is admin
            $user = _getGlobalData('user'); 
            if (!isset($user['is_admin']) || !$user['is_admin']) {
                throw new Exception('You are not the admin of the bot!');
            }
        }

## 💬 Conversations <a name="conversations"></a>

The Conversations feature enables seamless interaction between users and the bot by facilitating the retrieval of input values. It allows the bot to engage in dynamic and context-aware conversations with users, capturing their responses and providing personalized and tailored experiences. By utilizing Conversations, developers can effortlessly gather user input, process it, and deliver relevant and meaningful responses, enhancing the overall user experience and enabling more interactive and engaging interactions within the Telegram bot ecosystem.

To use this feature, you need to use Composer and it requires a `Symfony/Cache` adapter, such as `FilesystemAdapter`, `ApcuAdapter`, or others. By default, the library utilizes the `ArrayAdapter`, which is non-persistent and suitable for `LongPolling` mode and testing purposes.

For more information about adapters, check out [available cache adapters](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/cache.html#available-cache-adapters) in the main documentation.

If you wish to use other adapters like `ApcuAdapter`, `RedisAdapter`, `MemcachedAdapter` or others, you will need to install the necessary tools or extensions. Also these adapters are more suitable for Production.

We can't explain much about it and leave it up to you how to install related tools and extensions.

Here we examine an example:

```php
use Symfony\Component\Cache\Adapter\FilesystemAdapter;
use Symfony\Component\Cache\Psr16Cache;

use function DevDasher\PTB\_text;
use function DevDasher\PTB\_nextStepOfConversation;
use function DevDasher\PTB\_setConversationData;
use function DevDasher\PTB\_endConversation;
use function DevDasher\PTB\configurePTB;
use function DevDasher\PTB\onMessageText;
use function DevDasher\PTB\sendMessage;

configurePTB(
    token: 'TOKEN',
    username: 'USERNAME',

    # As mentioned, you need to use Composer and install requried packages for this.
    # Here we use the FilesystemAdapter:
    cache: new Psr16Cache(new FilesystemAdapter()),

    //...
);

# Here we examine a scenario of receiving input from the user in three steps
onMessageText('/register', function() { // FIRST STEP

    # When user send the /register command...
    # We ask the user's name (This is the first step)
    sendMessage(text: 'Send your name:');


    # This helper is to determine the next (second) step.
    # This will be executed later, when the user submits the second input
    _nextStepOfConversation(next_step: function() { // SECOND STEP

        # This will be the user's answer to the first question that we asked him for his name
        $text = _text();

        // Here you can put a validation for the $text variable to make sure that the user has sent a text to the bot.

        # Store user's name into a varaiable
        $name = $text;

        # With this helper, we store the user's input in the cache (as conversation data)
        _setConversationData('name', $name);
        # Note that this value will be passed as a parameter to the function you define for the next steps (third step...)

        # Now, This time we ask the user's age (We are still in the second step)
        sendMessage('Send your age:');

        # Again, since we need to get another value from the user,
        # We define the next step (third step) here:
        _nextStepOfConversation(
            // Here, we get the name we saved in the cache automatically
            //       in the function parameter. Related to the _setConversationData(...) helper.
            next_step: function($name) { // THIRD AND FINAL STEP

                # Storing the text value in a variable:
                $text = _text();

                // Some input validation for the $text variable goes here...

                # If the input value is correct, we store the user's age in another variable
                $age = $text;

                # And we thank the user for his cooperation :)
                sendMessage(text: "Thank you! Your registration was successful!\n\nYour Name: {$name}\nYour Age: {$age}");

                # And with this helper, we end the conversation.
                # Remember to call this function to end the conversation!
                # Otherwise, this step will be executed again with every user request!
                _endConversation();
            }
        );
    });
});
```

### Another And Better Example:

```php
use Symfony\Component\Cache\Adapter\FilesystemAdapter;
use Symfony\Component\Cache\Psr16Cache;

use function DevDasher\PTB\_text;
use function DevDasher\PTB\_messageId;
use function DevDasher\PTB\_input;
use function DevDasher\PTB\_setConversationData;
use function DevDasher\PTB\_endConversation;
use function DevDasher\PTB\configurePTB;
use function DevDasher\PTB\onMessageText;
use function DevDasher\PTB\sendMessage;

configurePTB(
    token: 'TOKEN',
    username: 'USERNAME',

    cache: new Psr16Cache(new FilesystemAdapter()),

    //...
);

onMessageText('/register', function() { // FIRST STEP

    # Alternative to the _nextStepOfConversation(...)
    _input(

        # This text will be send to the user with sendMessage method
        prompt: 'Send your name:',

        # Or you can pass a closure and send a message in your own way:
        // prompt: fn() => sendMessage(
        //     text: 'Send your name:',
        //     reply_to_message_id: _messageId(),
        // ),

        next_step: function() {  // SECOND STEP
            $text = _text();
            // ...
            // ...
            $name = $text;
            
            _setConversationData('name', $name);
        
            _input(
                prompt: 'Send your age:',

                next_step: function($name) { // THIRD AND FINAL STEP
                    $text = _text();
                    // ...
                    // ...
                    $age = $text;

                    sendMessage(text: "Thank you! Your registration was successful!\n\nYour Name: {$name}\nYour Age: {$age}");

                    _endConversation();
                },
            );

        }
        
    );

});
```

### Important Notice <a name="conversations-important-notice"></a>

In Procedural way the [laravel/serializableclosure](https://github.com/laravel/serializable-closure) package currently has issues with correctly identifying Named Parameters. Due to PHP's lack of support for `Closure Serialization`, we are forced to use on third-party packages.

This issue may cause certain problems for your bot! So, if you wish, wait until further notice (at least until this problem is resolved by the developers of this package or this feature is added by PHP itself in future versions).

If you have a solution for it, please raise it with relevant details in the [Issues](https://github.com/devdasher/ptb-php/issues) section or send your solution to [@devdasher](https://t.me/devdasher) in Telegram.

### OOP Way <a name="conversations-oop-way"></a>

Here, we implement the scenario that we examined in the previous examples in the OOP way:

```php
use function DevDasher\PTB\_setConversationData;
use function DevDasher\PTB\_text;
use function DevDasher\PTB\onMessageText;
use function DevDasher\PTB\sendMessage;

//...

# Suupose we have this class in our program:
class RegisterConversation {
    /*
        Additional notes:

        - The class name MUST end with 'Conversation', like: RegisterConversation, FeedbackConversation, etc.

        - The library automatically executes each method in the class in each step respectively.

            And after executing the last method in the class (step3), it automatically ends the conversation.

            But pay attention to the fact that the order of the methods in the class is very important.

            With this, you no longer need to call functions like _nextStepOfConversation(...) and _endConversation().
    */

    public function step1() { // FIRST STEP
        sendMessage('Send your name:');
    }

    public function step2() { // SECOND STEP
        $text = _text();
        //...
        //...
        $name = $text;

        _setConversationData('name', $name);

        sendMessage('Send your age:');
    }

    # We get the value of $name in the method parameter, that we have stored in the previous step (step 2):
    public function step3($name) { // THIRD AND FINAL STEP
        $text = _text();
        //...
        //...
        $age = $text;

        sendMessage(text: "Thank you! Your registration was successful!\n\nYour Name: {$name}\nYour Age: {$age}");
    }
}

# Here we only pass the class name:
onMessageText('/register', RegisterConversation::class);
# Currently, only the class name can be passed as above. This will be improved later.

//...
```
## 🎮 Keyboards <a name="keyboards"></a>

The PTB-PHP library provides a simple way to build and send keyboards.

### ReplyKeyboardMarkup <a name="reply-keyboard-markup"></a>

The `ReplyKeyboardMarkup(...)` function helps you to create a reply keyabord. Here is an example:

```php
use function DevDasher\PTB\_row;
use function DevDasher\PTB\onMessageText;
use function DevDasher\PTB\sendMessage;
use function DevDasher\PTB\ReplyKeyboardMarkup;
use function DevDasher\PTB\KeyboardButton;

onMessageText(pattern: '/start', callable: function() {
    sendMessage(
        text: 'START Message',
        reply_markup: ReplyKeyboardMarkup(
            keyboard: [
                _row(KeyboardButton(text: 'Say Hi!'), KeyboardButton(text: 'Say Bye!')),
            ],
            is_persistent: true,
            resize_keyboard: true,
            //...
        )
    );
});

onMessageText(pattern: 'Say Hi!', callable: fn() => sendMessage('Hi!'));

onMessageText(pattern: 'Say Bye!', callable: fn() => sendMessage('Bye!'));
```

### ReplyKeyboardRemove <a name="reply-keyboard-remove"></a>

Use `ReplyKeyboardRemove(...)` to remove an existing `ReplyMarkupKeyboard`:

```php
use function DevDasher\PTB\_row;
use function DevDasher\PTB\ReplyKeyboardMarkup;
use function DevDasher\PTB\KeyboardButton;
use function DevDasher\PTB\ReplyKeyboardRemove;
use function DevDasher\PTB\onMessageText;
use function DevDasher\PTB\sendMessage;

onMessageText('/keyboard', function() {
    sendMessage(
        text: 'START',
        reply_markup: ReplyKeyboardMarkup(
            keyboard: [
                _row(KeyboardButton(text: 'Button 1'), KeyboardButton(text: 'Button 2'))
            ],
            resize_keyboard: true,
        ),
    );
});

onMessageText('/remove_keyboard', function() {
    sendMessage(
        text: 'Keyboard Removed!',
        reply_markup: ReplyKeyboardRemove(/* ... */),
    );
});
```

### InlineKeyboardMarkup <a name="inline-keyboard-markup"></a>

The `InlineKeyboardMarkup(...)` function helps you to create a inline keyabord. Here is an example:

```php
use function DevDasher\PTB\_row;
use function DevDasher\PTB\answerCallbackQuery;
use function DevDasher\PTB\InlineKeyboardButton;
use function DevDasher\PTB\InlineKeyboardMarkup;
use function DevDasher\PTB\onCallbackQueryData;
use function DevDasher\PTB\onMessageText;
use function DevDasher\PTB\sendMessage;

onMessageText(pattern: '/account', callable: function() {
    sendMessage(
        text: "Account Details\n\n...",
        reply_markup: InlineKeyboardMarkup(
            inline_keyboard: [
                _row(
                    InlineKeyboardButton(text: 'Suspend', callback_data: 'account/suspend'),
                    InlineKeyboardButton(text: 'Delete', callback_data: 'account/delete')
                ),
            ],
        )
    );
});

onCallbackQueryData(
    pattern: 'account/suspend',
    callable: fn() => answerCallbackQuery(text: 'Account Suspended', show_alert: true)
);

onCallbackQueryData(
    pattern: 'account/delete',
    callable: fn() => answerCallbackQuery(text: 'Account Deleted', show_alert: true)
);
```

### ForceReply <a name="force-reply"></a>

```php
use function DevDasher\PTB\sendMessage;
use function DevDasher\PTB\ForceReply;

//...
    sendMessage(
        text: 'Send your picture:',

        # We force the user to reply on the bot's message
        #   It is only related to the UI and it is an apparent compulsion
        reply_markup: ForceReply(input_field_placeholder: 'Send A Photo'),
    ),
//...
```

## 🧩 Handlers <a name="handlers"></a>

Handlers are essential components in building interactive and dynamic conversational experiences. They enable the customization of logic and actions based on specific triggers or conditions. For instance, handlers can be triggered by user messages, chat joins, button clicks, or any other desired action for the bot to respond appropriately. Key aspects of handlers include event binding, where they are associated with specific events; logic and actions, which define what happens when the event occurs; event types, allowing handlers to cater to different event categories; registration, ensuring appropriate handler invocation upon event occurrence; and customization, enabling the bot to respond differently based on various situations. Leveraging handlers effectively facilitates the creation of chatbots capable of interactive and adaptable user interactions, while offering a maintainable and extensible code structure.

Here is a list of all available handlers in the library:

## 🚁 Helpers <a name="helpers"></a>

Helpers refer to a set of utility functions (or constants...) that are designed to assist developers in performing common tasks or operations more efficiently. These helper functions encapsulate commonly used code snippets, providing a convenient way to reuse and simplify complex logic. By abstracting away repetitive or boilerplate code, function helpers enhance code readability, maintainability, and promote modular programming practices. They can range from simple functions for string manipulation or array operations to more advanced functionalities like file handling, database interactions, or API integrations. Function helpers serve as valuable tools in libraries, empowering developers to streamline their workflow and focus on higher-level application logic.

Here is a list of all available helpers in the library:

✍️ **Note:** In the table below, in the `Description` column, the term `ANY` (with capital letters) refers to one of update types, like `message`, `edited_message`, `channel_post`, `edited_channel_post` and in some cases `callback_query`. etc.

## ♟ Usage Without Handlers <a name="usage-without-handlers"></a>

If you are not comfortable with existing handlers and this type of coding, there is no problem. You can choose your own code style.

You just need to pass your bot token and username to the `configurePTB(...)` function and continue the rest of the code as you like.

Here is an example:

### Webhook implementation: <a name="without-handlers-webhook-implementation"></a>

```php
use function DevDasher\PTB\configurePTB;
use function DevDasher\PTB\sendMessage;

$input = file_get_contents('php://input');
$update = json_decode($input, true);
// Here, you can use the __setUpdate($update) for work with all the available helper functions
// See the next example.

configurePTB(
    token: 'TOKEN',
    username: 'USERNAME',

    # Here you can pass the $update directly
    # But in this example we do not do this
    // update: $udpate,


    //...
);

$updateId = $update['update_id'];

if (isset($update['message'])) {
    $message = $update['message'];

    $from = $message['from'];
    $chat = $message['chat'];

    $chatId = $chat['id'];
    $text = $message['text'] ?? null;

    //...
}

if ($text === '/start') {
    return sendMessage(text: 'START', chat_id: $chatId);
}

//...
//...
//...
```

#### Another Example:

```php
use function DevDasher\PTB\_text;
use function DevDasher\PTB\_chatId;
use function DevDasher\PTB\__setUpdate;
use function DevDasher\PTB\configurePTB;
use function DevDasher\PTB\sendMessage;

$input = file_get_contents('php://input');
$update = json_decode($input, true);

configurePTB(
    token: 'TOKEN',
    username: 'USERNAME',

    # Pass the $update directly
    update: $udpate,

    //...
);
// __setUpdate($update); // Or pass the $update in this way.


$text = _text(); // Now, we can use all available helper functions. like this one here.
$chatId = _chatId();
//...

if ($text === '/start') {
    return sendMessage(
        text: 'START ANY',
        // chat_id: $chatId, // And here, we don't need to pass the $chatId anymore
    );
}

//...
//...
//...

```

### LongPolling Implementation <a name="without-handlers-longpolling-implementation"></a>

```php
use function DevDasher\PTB\configurePTB;
use function DevDasher\PTB\getUpdates;

configurePTB(
    token: 'TOKEN',
    username: 'USERNAME',
    //...
);

$updates = getUpdates(/* ... */);

foreach ($updates as $update) {
    //...
}

//...
//...
//...
```

### 🧱 Usage With OOP <a name="usage-with-oop"></a>

The PTB-PHP library provides developers with the flexibility to utilize object-oriented programming (OOP) alongside procedural code. While the library primarily encourages a procedural approach, it acknowledges that certain scenarios may require OOP concepts. As such, PTB-PHP allows the use of classes and objects within middleware and handlers, offering developers the freedom to incorporate OOP where necessary, rather than limiting them to pure functions.

Let's see an example:
```php
use function DevDasher\PTB\middleware;
use function DevDasher\PTB\sendMessage;
use function DevDasher\PTB\onMessageText;

# Suppose we have two clasess, one for handler, and another for middleware:
class StartCommand {
    # This is a magic method in PHP that allows us to call a class as if it were a callable
    public function __invoke() {
        sendMessage(text: 'Start');
        //...
        //...
    }
    //...
}

class CheckUserStatusMiddleware {
    public function __invoke() {
        sendMessage(text: 'Hello from '.__CLASS__);
        //...
        //...
    }
    //...
}

# Here, we pass the class name for middleware:
middleware(CheckUserStatusMiddleware::class);

# Or pass an object of class:
// middleware(new CheckUserStatusMiddleware);

# Or pass class and method name in an array like this:
// middleware([CheckUserStatusMiddleware::class, 'method_name']);
// middleware([new CheckUserStatusMiddleware, 'method_name']);

# And here, we pass a class name for handler:
onMessageText(pattern: '/start', callable: StartCommand::class);

# Or pass an object of class:
// onMessageText(pattern: '/start', callable: new StartCommand);

# Or pass class and method name in an array like this:
// onMessageText(pattern: '/start', callable: [StartCommand::class, 'method_name']);
// onMessageText(pattern: '/start', callable: [new StartCommand, 'method_name']);


# Here we define some additional commands assuming that we have defined related classes somewhere in the program:
onMessageText(
    pattern: '/admin',
    callable: AdminCommand::class,

    # A middleware for checking if user is an admin or not
    middlewares: AdminAuthMiddleware::class, 

    # Of course, if you need multiple middlewares, just pass them in an array
    // middlewares: [AdminAuthMiddleware::class, AnotherMiddleware::class, /* ... */ ],


    # Here we say that the CheckUserStatusMiddleware class sould not be executed before this handler
    skip_middlewares: CheckUserStatusMiddleware::class,

    # Of course, if you need to pass multiple middleware names, just pass them in an array
    // middlewares: [CheckUserStatusMiddleware::class, AnotherMiddlewareToSkip::class, /* ... */ ],
);

//...

## 🚀 Performance <a name="performance"></a>

The performance of a Telegram bot is crucial for providing a seamless user experience. Response speed plays a vital role in ensuring timely interactions and satisfying user expectations. To improve the performance of a Telegram bot built with PHP, several methods can be employed. Firstly, optimizing code efficiency by minimizing unnecessary computations and database queries can significantly enhance response speed. Caching frequently accessed data or utilizing in-memory caching systems like Redis can also boost performance. Additionally, employing asynchronous processing techniques, such using queues or event-driven architectures, can help handle concurrent requests more efficiently. Utilizing a scalable infrastructure with load balancing and horizontal scaling can further improve performance by distributing the workload across multiple servers. Regular monitoring and profiling of the bot's performance can identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization, allowing for continuous improvement.

In the future, we will provide you with additional explanations and training in this particular field to ensure that you can achieve optimal performance with our library, PTB-PHP.
